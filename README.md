# **HAXKEY** 
**Is basically a concept of increasing and providing more security to the User credentials using our Custom Cipheration and Decipheration Algorithm Technique.**

* The User Data that is entered into the system is stored in the database of the managing Organisation after it has been passed on through the Functionality of the Algorithm.
* It will helpful in Providing more Security to User data and more Reliability against Prominent Cyber Attacks like Phishing and SQL Injection.


**Functioning:**
* The data that is entered for Eg. Username, Password, Contact Number, Full Name, etc.. is Ciphered using our custom Algorithm.
*  The data then is passed onto for storing as in a Hash Table using the Concept of CHAINING.
*  Incase the user or the company want to access the Decipherated version of the User Credentials, then the Admin has the option of decoding the encoded credentials  back into the    earlier inputted form.
*  The data till then is stored into the hash table which is accessible by the database in the form of encrypted text.
*  All options are been given to facilitate the data based on the User and the Organisation.


**Advantages**:
* More easy Access to User data.
* More security and Protection of User data against Active and Hazardous Cyber Attacks.
* Fast retrieval of Data as Accessing data from Hash table is very Fast operation.


**To Run the Program :**
* The Program is written in C++14 so it is must to have GNU Compiler in the System.
* Open the Program in some IDE (VS Code / Code Blocks/ Netbeans are Preferred) and run the Program.
* Enter the Data Accordingly and Follow the Guided steps inside the .exe Program to see the results.
